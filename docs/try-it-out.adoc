== Try it out

$ cachix use neovim-flake # Optional: it'll save you CPU resources and time
$ nix run github:notashelf/neovim-flake # will run the default configuration

=== Nix

By default LSP support for Nix is enabled alongside all complementary Neovim plugins. By running `nix run .`, which is the default package,
you will build Neovim with this config.

=== Tidal

Tidal is an alternative config that adds vim-tidal on top of the plugins from the Nix configuration.

=== Maximal

Maximal is the ultimate configuration that will enable basically everything. Keep in mind, however, that this will pull a lot of dependencies.

You are strongly recommended to use the binary cache if you would like to try the Maximal configuration.
